# my-portfolio

For this project I was tasked with creating my own portfolio that is not only functional but is also responsive. Using bootstrap frameworks, and grids I was able to accomplish this. I also added a navigation bar using bootstrap, with a little bit of JavaScript. After completing all of the necessary requirements, I ran both the CSS and html pages through a validation service to correct any and all errors.
